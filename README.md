This repository contains the pre-trained model weights, associated code, and complete dataset of the paper [GAIA: A Global, Multi-modal, Multi-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09598).

**GAIA** is a large-scale vision-language dataset designed to bridge the gap between remote sensing (RS) imagery and natural language understanding. It provides **205,150 image-text pairs** (41,030 images with 5 synthetic captions each) for advancing RS-specific vision-language models (VLMs). The dataset spans over **25 years** of Earth observations (1998-2024), covering diverse geographic regions, satellite missions, and RS modalities.

## Dataset Structure üìÇ
GAIA has been split into **train (70%)**, **test (20%)**, and **validation (10%)** sets, which are spatio-temporally stratified. The dataset splits are provided in JSON files compatible with the img2dataset tool. This approach enables seamless access and reconstruction of the dataset for research purposes. 

Each entry contains a set of web-scraped (i.e. image_src, image_alt, credits) and extracted (i.e. location, tag, resolution, satellite, sensor, modalities) or synthetically-generated data (i.e. lat, lon, captions):
```json
[
  "id", 
  "image_src",
  "image_alt",
  "captions",
  "credits",
  "location",
  "lat",
  "lon",
  "tag",
  "resolution",
  "satellite",
  "sensor",
  "modalities"
]
```

## Download Instructions ‚¨áÔ∏è
To download and reconstruct the GAIA dataset, follow these steps:
- Download the GAIA dataset JSON files from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/azavras/GAIA).
  ```bash
  huggingface-cli download azavras/GAIA --repo-type dataset --local-dir GAIA
  ```
- Install and use the [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) tool to reconstruct the GAIA dataset.
  ```bash
  img2dataset --url_list "./{split}_data.json" \
              --input_format "json" \
              --url_col "image_src" \
              --caption_col "image_alt" \
              --output_format "webdataset" \
              --save_additional_columns "['id','captions']" \
              --output_folder "./{split}/" \
              --processes_count 4 \
              --thread_count 4 \
              --retries=5 \
              --image_size 512 \
              --encode_format "png" \
              --encode_quality 9 \
              --resize_mode "keep_ratio" \
              --number_sample_per_shard 512 \
              --disallowed_header_directives '[]'
  ```
  ‚ùó Significantly increasing the **processes_count** and **thread_count** may lead to server overload, potentially causing interruptions and failures in downloads.

  ‚ùó Some users have reported that **img2dataset** appears to start correctly (with no error messages) but then hangs indefinitely without downloading any samples. We suggest users experiencing this issue to use an **img2dataset** Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/marianna13/spark-img2dataset).
